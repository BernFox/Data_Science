This was clear in anything and everything Starlin wrote following it (starting with <i>Infinity War</i>, which makes it pretty explicit, and was the next writing to feature Thanos\\xc2\\xb9), but boring, lame-o other writers couldn\\'t be arsed to keep up and went, ""What was his thing again...? Oh yeah, he\\'s in love with Death!""\\nStarlin brought it up once after that, in <i>The End</i>, in which Thanos has clearly progressed far beyond that, but refers to her as his love all the same--though still in a way suggesting he had moved on, long ago, from pursuing this. She didn\\'t appear at all in what was to be his ongoing series (until Marvel pissed Starlin off for good)--that is, until Keith Giffen took over for the last six issues of it.\\n\\nI say this with love for Ron Marz (I\\'m a Kyle Rayner fan, even with his writing leading to an infamous comics-critical blog named for an event in *that* story...) and Keith Giffen. But everyone other than Starlin (including those two) tried to boil Thanos back down to a simplistic core: ""He\\'s the dude in love with Death!"" Though, to be fair, Giffen and Marz at least had a handle on the tenuous nature of his villainy, and even that it was almost abandoned--indeed, Giffen supports his aim to prevent the destruction of the universe as he writes him.\\n\\nBut no, he <b>was</b> the lover of Death. The same as he was once a Darkseid knock-off of sorts. The same as he once pursued power purely for power\\'s sake.\\xc2\\xa0 But those things all changed. Each story Starlin put him through over time gave him more and more dimension--as he asked himself at the end of <i>Infinity War</i>: ""And what now are you, Lord Thanos? Hero? Villain? Neither? Maybe just wiser.""\\n\\nIt was shameful the way an extremely rounded character kept being sanded back down to two dimensions every time someone else got their hands on him...I actually got into a fight with the editor of <i>Annihilation</i> over this, who told me that the storyline of Thanos in said book was to prevent exactly what I hated: lame writers screwing the character up further (so I apologized).\\n\\nI grew up going ""Oooh! So many characters!!!"" when I first saw <i>Infinity War</i> on newsstands, but was taken in by Thanos and his peculiar character, which was neither good nor evil, nor even amoral or simplistically ""grey"" or antihero. Everyone turning him back into ""Oh, he\\'s in love with Death and wants to be with Death,"" was always such a waste of potential...\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb9""Death has rejected me.

In addition to money, Romney won because Newt is bombastic and is likely a serious liability in the general ... all the polls show it and intelligent conservatives feel it ... this is about style not substance. Both will do the basically the same things in office just with entirely different styles. Newt ruffles feathers all day long with his growing obsession to draw stark contrasts all of the time ... especially when if and when it entails lying or exagerrating ... like calling Mitt anti-immigrant on national TV, unbelievable. \\n\\nAnd since Peggy Hill knows less about national politics than I do since I have studied it to some degree for 25 odd years, I'm not inclined to be persuaded by her often amateurish, yet heartfelt, patriotic opinions. She describes the political scene the way I used to 15 years ago ... lots of generalities with little to no expertise, so I don't pay her a lot of attention when we disagree. In fairness, her scope of knowledge, when it comes to national politics, is growing by the day. I feel she would be competent to run for VP in 2016 but I would much rather see her in a Dept of Energy position since she gets on my nerves from time to time (though not badly) and I don't trust her instincts as much these days since she wants Mitt out of the race ... the one guy who is sure to beat Owebamao! Of course she hasn't said she wants Mitt out but we all know she does because she is behind Newt, 100%.\\n\\nSarah Palin is a Great American and I love her and Newt dearly but this is not the time to vote with my heart ... way too much at stake! Newt is the world's best field general but his temper and tone are starting to wear on me and I'm conservative, for Pete's sake ... I can only imagine how offended some Independents are beginning to feel. \\n\\nSure it helped that Mitt raised more money ... and that is essential in beating Dingle Barry, as well. Sarah kinda sounds like an OWS'er ranting that Mitt had too much money as if Newt wouldn't have wanted to have that much money, too. And thank God Mitt raised all that cash ... after all ... that's what it's all about! So you Newt zombies really ought to do the Hokey Pokey and turn yourselves around, lol.\\n\\nIf Newt will fold under lies and carpet bombing ... as he said he would ... then he's got zero chance of beating Owebamao ... think about it ... that's all Barry does.

I know he will beat Owebamao (all that matters) and I know he will attract Independents and Latinos in 2014... particularly with a Romney/Rubio ticket. My first choice for POTUS is a Christy/Rubio ticket ... neither are running but both back Romney.\\n\\nBy the time Super Tuesday rolls around, Mitt will prolly already be the clear front runner but I never count Newt out.\\n\\nBut for Peggy Hill to be upset Mitt raised and outspent Newt is laughable .... that's what you're supposed to do!\\n\\n\\nBTW Folks - Remember the Sirens???\\n\\nBeautiful half-woman, half-bird, Newt-like creatures who sang such sweet songs that listeners forgot about everything including their own safety. The Sirens were Newtish sisters who lured sailors to their untimely deaths. The songs of the Sirens were irresistible but they resided beyond unsurpassable reefs which destroyed the sailors' boat (think Costa Concordia) when they tried to reach the Sirens. Among those tempted were Jason on the Argo and Odysseus. Odysseus escaped from them by filling his crew's ears with wax while he tied himself to the ship's mast, thus finally allowing the GOP to win their prize ........ just sayin'."""5/15/12 6:35,"""what people?

The Amercian Revolution was based on many different factors, slavery only one of them. Industrialism was also one of them. Many of our founding father's had slaves up until the time that Lincoln set them free.\\n\\nOh... and slavery was the white man putting the black man in the yoke of the plow? Sorry but blacks sold blacks into slavery, that is how the white people got them. But the truth does not end there. Whites and native americans were also slaves. If you are still disillusioned Africa still has a slavery problem with blacks are kidnapping blacks and .... selling them into slavery.\\n\\nBlacks should get over slavery because you are not slaves, you have not been slaves. Those who were slaves, the ones who had a right to be pissed about it are now dead. Move on and concetrate on making the most out of your life that you can.\\n\\nBlacks fighting for America? No I'm not one of those who thought they didn't fight until WW2 but I'm sure that many blacks don't know or refuse to acknowledgs that there were free blacks who fought for the south against the north. \\n\\nI am not racist. \\n\\nBut I am damn tired of someone expecting something because the color of their skin. When I was in high school a black boy came to me and said 'move over'. I replied 'No.' He went and told the vice principal that I wouldn't allow him to sit down because he was black. I only wish I had had the courage to speak up and say that it was because he was rude. Had he asked politely I would have shared my seat.\\n\\nDuring highschool I endure quietly being struck in the back of the head by black girls because I was white. I had to endure vicious teasing from them because I was white. To what civic group to I complain to to get justice for this?\\n\\nI once worked in a video arcade where a young black girl grabbed a moving game and held on to it so that the alarm went off. She must have been four so I crouched down not to over whem her, talked softly and told her the game was ment to be hit with the mallet and she couldn't hold on to the pieces. Her father started screaming at me for correcting his child because she didn't know any better and threated to cause me physical harm. I had to run to my office while his wife tried to pull him away. Of course she didn't know any better that is why i explained how to play the game to her... and you call me racist?\\n\\nI believe that black's still have problems because they don't want to let go of the excuse...

It was brought to my attention that my kids were buying lunch, but not eating it. I decided to pack their lunch. My kids will not eat a sandwich so I decided I was not going to waste food or money packing a sandwich and instead substituted cheese and crackers or peanut butter crackers, which is an appropriate substitute for grain/meat. I then packed carrots, a fruit (generally an orange or apple) or a fruit cup, and a granola bar (also a grain alternative. I was sent a note home that it was unacceptable to not have a sandwich included in their lunch. I worked at the time in the lunch room of a day care and knew what was acceptable and unacceptable according to the USDA, but in my opinion what the USDA requires of a public facility offering lunch and what I offer should be totally seperate. The eating habits of my children is my business, their health is in my hands. I feel sorry for children whose parents choose to set bad examples, and for parents that don't care enough and let their children live off of take out and junk but that is their choice. \\nI will now address the abortion issue that was thrown in just because I find it A) outrageous to even mention it, and B) because people are uneducated and base take things out of context or base it off of hearsay and uneducated opinions. I personally don't believe it's right in all circumstances. I believe there are other options, I believe that their are also situations where it may be necessary, medically, or mentally; as in a rape case. BUT I also believe that it is our bodies, we do in fact own them, the fetus is a person but it is not seperated from you until birth, which makes it yours until then. State has enough power already, controlling what I do with my body is my business. I don't believe they should be allowed to tell me I can or can't have one. I also don't think all insurance companies should have to pay for it, unless of course it's a medically neccessary procedure due to health risks of the mother, the fetus or in the case of rape/incest. I don't think insurance companies should be allowed to tell you that you can't buy birth control, that is taking it to far. I realize certain religions don't believe in birth control, they believe that if God wants you to have a baby he'll give you one but he didn't put these people on Earth that invented these things for nothing. If there was a flood and a boat came by I would get in, I wouldn't wait for God, God sent the boat. I wish people would realize that this country is religiously diverse, it was founded on religious diversity, state and religion should be seperate and publicly owened companies (company's with stock on NASDAQ etc.) and religion should be seperate. No religion has the right to enforce their beliefs on others. It's sad to say that as Christian, especially of the Baptist denomination that is more frequent than in any other religion. The religion that worships Alla (sp) doesn't ask that everyone bow down for 10 minutes at high noon for prayer, Catholics don't require or ask other religions to go to confession, Jews don't ask that more Jewish holidays be made official government holidays. The Baptist scream for Christmas, and Easter and anti abortion (as do the Catholic on that one (they are a denomination of Christians). I just think people need less power and more tolerance of others. Jesus/God was not a judgemental person, in fact he was the opposite of that, he taught acceptance and love of all, even those that turned away from him. We could all learn from that, quit thumping your Bible and actually read it. """5/29/12 22:01,"""Not sure you were supposed to remember that....haha..."""6/10/12 12:23,"""I clicked ""reply"".

Darrell Issa, chairman of the House committee on \\nOversight and Government Reform, took a major step toward holding \\nAttorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for his failure to \\nprovide subpoenaed documents and other information about Operation Fast \\nand Furious.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a Jan. 31 letter, Issa had threatened Holder with such a move if he \\nfailed to provide all the subpoenaed documents relating to the Fast and \\nFurious gunwalking scandal by Feb. 9. That deadline has come and gone, \\nand Holder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department of Justice still hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provided most of those \\ndocuments. Issa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subpoena dates back to Oct. 12, 2011.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Tuesday in a seven-page letter, Issa revealed that Deputy Attorney \\nGeneral James Cole begged Congress to extend the Feb. 9 deadline. Issa \\nwrote that the request was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cironic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cignores the reality that the \\nDepartment has unreasonably delayed producing these documents to the \\nCommittee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn its face, the requested extension demonstrates a lack of good \\nfaith,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Issa wrote to Holder. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith one exception, the Department has \\nonly produced documents responsive to the subpoena on the eve of \\ncongressional hearings in which senior Department officials testified. \\nThe Department appears to be more concerned with protecting its image \\nthrough spin control than actually cooperating with Congress.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cannot wait any longer for the Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooperation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Issa \\ncontinued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs such, please specify a date by which you expect the \\nDepartment to produce all documents responsive to the subpoena. In \\naddition, please specify a Department representative who will interface \\nwith the Committee for production purposes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nIssa added that whoever Holder designates as the go-to DOJ official for \\ndelivering subpoenaed documents \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshould also serve as the conduit for \\ndealing with the contempt proceedings, should the Department continue to\\n ignore the Committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subpoena.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (RELATED: Full coverage of Eric \\nHolder)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe California Republican slammed Holder, too, for claiming the \\ncongressional investigation into Fast and Furious was a political game \\nfor Republicans.\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more: http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/14/issa-takes-step-toward-holding-holder-in-contempt-of-congress/#ixzz1mQNF3g00\\n\\n\\n\\n""","""Well Happy BIrthday should we asked how many candles to blow out"""6/12/12 2:08,"""dan_amd\n\nYou have realy no clue on every single idiotic comment of all your posts.WE ALL DON'T enjoy your stupid PRO AMD B:U:L:L:S:H:I:T ignorance.Please crawl back then in the fat ass of your gay loving buddy charliedemerjian semiinaccurate and try to find the light inside - U stupid FAG!\n\nWE REALY DON'T NEED AND WANT YOUR POST HERE ANYMORE!"""5/29/12 18:25,"""If you pay for those services and you don't have another way to easily get them on your television, XBL gold is not a bad method especially if you already own XBoxes.\n\nI mean.. realistically at most it will cost you $5 a month if you sign up for a whole year.
